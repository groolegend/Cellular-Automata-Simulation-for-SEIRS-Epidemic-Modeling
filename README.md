# Cellular-Automata-Simulation-for-SEIRS-Epidemic-Modeling
This repository implements a GPU-accelerated **SEIRS** epidemic model using Cellular Automata (CA) to simulate the spread of infectious diseases. By incorporating additional rules, this model offers a more realistic simulation of epidemic dynamics, improving the accuracy and efficiency of predictions compared to traditional SEIRS models.

Features
* GPU Acceleration: Utilizes the computational power of GPUs to significantly speed up the simulation, making it scalable and efficient for large-scale epidemic studies.
* Enhanced SEIRS Model: In addition to the standard Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered (SEIRS) compartments, new rules and dynamics have been incorporated to better reflect real-world disease transmission patterns.
* Cellular Automata Framework: The simulation is based on a cellular automata approach, which allows for spatially explicit modeling of the disease spread across a grid.
* Realistic Epidemic Spread: Includes factors like variable infection rates, incubation periods, and localized outbreaks, making it more accurate in simulating real-world epidemic scenarios.
